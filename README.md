# Machine Learning: Chocolate Bar rating

#### CHOCOLATE IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR CANDIES IN THE WORLD. EACH YEAR, THE UNITED STATES CONSUMERS EAT MORE THAN 2.8 BILLIONS POUNDS. HOWEVER, NOT ALL CHOCOLATE BARS ARE CREATED EQUAL!

#### THIS DATASET CONTAINS EXPERT RATINGS OF OVER 2,700 INDIVIDUAL CHOCOLATE BARS, ALONG WITH INFORMATION ON THEIR BEAN ORIGIN, PERCENTAGE OF COCOA, THE VARIETY OF CHOCOLATE BEAN USED AND WHERE THE BEANS WERE GROWN.

# GOALS:

#### THE GOAL IS TO LEARN ABOUT CHOCOLATES. IDENTIFY THE COUNTRIES THAT PRODUCE THE BEST COCA BEANS, KNOWING MORE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COCA SOLIDS PERCENTAGE AND RATINGS AND IF THE AMOUNT AND SELECTION OF THE INGREDIENTS MATTER TO THE QUALITY OF THE TASTE.
#### KEY QUESTIONS:
#### 1. WHAT IS THE AVERAGE RATING BY COUNTRY OF ORIGIN?
#### 2. WHERE ARE THE BEST COCOA BEANS GROWN?
#### 3. WHICH COUNTRIES PRODUCE THE HIGHEST-RATED BARS?
#### 4. WHAT ARE THE TOP COMPANIES THAT PRODUCE MOST CHOCOLATE BARS?
#### 5. IS THERE A CORRELATION BETWEEN COCA PERCENTAGE AND CHOCOLATE RATINGS?
#### 6. IS THE CACAO BEAN'S ORIGIN AN INDICATOR OF QUALITY?
#### 7. WHICH ARE THE MOST COMMON INGREDIENTS USED?
#### 8. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF COCOA HAS THE HIGHEST RATING?

#### TO DO THIS I WILL CLEAN AND CONDITION THE DATA TO FIT INTO A SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHM AND UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHM; USING PYTHON AND EDA USING VISUALIZATIONS.
